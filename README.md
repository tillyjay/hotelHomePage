# hotelHomePage

This index page is a sign up for a fictitious hotel hospitality website.

This page was created with HTML and CSS for the structure and design, and then layered with basic JavaScript for form validation. The image on the right was created in Adobe Photoshop. The image on the left was a self designed logo created in Adobe Illustrator. 

This was my first time working with photoshop and illustrator and although there is a bit of learning curve it was cool to use image manipulation software. As a developer it's good fun getting to work with more creative tools and add some basic design skills to my skillset.
